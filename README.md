TimeCapture
===========

Captures time. Records what application is in the foreground and what file/directory/URL is opened.

Python, Open Source, easy to add support for other platforms and apps (so far mostly MacOSX support). Patches are welcome. :)

Just run `./capture.py`.

Later goals:

* Make statistics based on that data.

Also, time management:

* Maybe something like [Pomodoro](https://github.com/ugol/pomodoro)?

* [Selfspy](https://github.com/gurgeh/selfspy). Open Source (GPL), Python, cross-platform.
  But rather than storing what app runs in the foreground, and what URL/file is opened,
  it stores the window title, process name, and all pressed keys.
